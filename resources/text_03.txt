Hi,
I am Min TZING, Managing Director of Flamenco Realty.  I am writing to report a deal which has aroused my suspicion.
On 13 Dec 2012 (2:00 pm), my realtor (Sammy Sung) informed me by text messages that he was preparing an offer (property address: 3330 Southbend Road, West Vancouver  C2V 9K7).  He asked if it was legal when both the buyer and seller agreed to accept two million Canadian dollars as deposit and the deposit would be released to the seller directly on 13 Mar 2019 as agreed by both parties.  I replied that both parties should find their own legal representatives and deposit could be submitted to the buyer's lawyer or our Brokerage.  The release of the deposit would be handled by the lawyers.  
Our Brokerage received the deposit ($200,000) on 14 Dec 2012 and receipt was issued.  The subject free offer was received by email on 17 Dec 2012.   On the page 2 of 6 in the contract, it states 'The Buyers agree to increase the deposit to TWO MILLION Dollars on or before January 13th, 2013 and authorize the selling brokerage 'Amex Flamenco Realty' to release the TWO MILLION DOLLARS deposit directly to the Seller, no later than January 11th, 2013.' 
According to my realtor, the buyers realized the risk and the deposit would be held by the seller if the deal was not going to complete.   Therefore, I required our Realtor to add an addendum to mention 'Buyer and seller both agree that, if the buyer fails to complete the deal on Feb 25, 2013, the total deposit (two million Canadian dollars) is irreversible.  That is, the total deposit will not be returned to the buyer and the seller will keep the deposit (two million Canadian dollars) as compensation after Feb 24, 2013.  Both parties agree not to file any lawsuit upon the failure of deal completion.'   However, the buyers refused to sign the addendum and refused to appoint any legal representatives to handle the release of the deposit.
After discussing with my realtor, I found the following points of suspicion:
Buyers insisted not to find a lawyer to represent them and handle the large amount of deposit.  They simply wanted to wire the deposit and the remaining amount (Four Million Dollars) directly to our trust account from overseas.  I refused and confirmed that our Brokerage can only accept the deposit by bank draft issued by local Canadian banks.
Since they refused to appoint the lawyers to release the deposit, I didn't approve the clause  written on page 2 of 6 in the contract.
I am therefore writing to seek your guidance on this deal.  Attached you can find the contract and the emails concerning this deal.  Since it is very urgent, I would like to require your prompt reply to this report before 06 Feb 2013.  Thank you.

Min TZING
