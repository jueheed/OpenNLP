Investigation of HBCA client Jong CHEN identified a wire transfer from a third party individual that was used to facilitate multiple cash withdrawals.  A continuation of previously reported activity was observed.  Memo on the wire also conflicts with observed activity.  As such, there are reasonable grounds to suspect the activity as being a money laundering offence.

Investigation of account #111-111111-123 identified multiple cash withdrawals (total of CAD 30,200.00) that were mainly funded by two incoming wire transfers from a third party individual; Jackie CHEN (total of CAD 45,300.00).  While it is reasonable to infer that the remitter has familial ties to the client, the activity appears to be a continuation of previous reported activity.  According to previous correspondence, client noted that he?s being funded by his parents for overseas study.  However, source of funds remains unverified and the cash withdrawals were rapidly depleted in separate occasions at different branch locations; indicative of flow through.  Memo on the wires noted that they were for tuition purposes, however this may conflict with observed activity as the funds were withdrawn subsequently in cash.  Ultimate destination of funds remains unknown.  As such, there are reasonable grounds to suspect the activity above as being potential commission of a money laundering related offence.
